Managed Nodes:
- resource allocation
	- resource allocation is at the node pool lvelel
	- specify spu and mo√¨emory resource requirements for a node pool
- load balancing
	- load balancing is between worker nodes
- pod networking
	- both the vnc-native pod networking CNI plugin and the flannel CNI plugin are supported.
- scaling k8s cluster and node pools
	- customers have the responsability for adjusting cluster capacity in response to changing requirements
	- scale the cluster and node pool up and down by changing the number of managed node pools and nodes, respectively
	- enable autoscaling to automatically scale managed node pools and pods
- pricing:
	- you pay for the computer instances that execute applications

Virtual nodes:
- resource allocation
	- resource alocation is at the pos level
	- specify spu and memory resource requirements (ad requests and limits) in the pods specification
- load balancing
	- load balancing is between pods
	- you alway must manually configurare load balancing security rules
	- load balancers distribuiscono il traffico tramite pods IP addresses and assigned nodee port. tramite la sintassi <pod_ip>:nodeport>
- pod networking
	- only VCN-native pod networking is supported
	- only one VNIC is attached to each virtual node
	- ip addresses are not pre-allocated before pods are created
	- the VCN-Native Pod Networking CNI plugin is not shown as running in the kube-system namespace
	- pod subnet route table must fave route rules defined for a NAT gateway (not ad internet gateway) and a service gateway
- scaling k8s cluster and node pools
	- operational overhead of cluster capacity managment is handled for you
	- a virtual node pool scales automatically and support up to 500 pods per virtual node
	- increase the number of virtual node pools or virtual nodes to scale up the cluster or node pool, respectively
- pricing
	- toy pay for the exact compute resources consumed by each kuberneter pod
